# scratch-programming-irl
Overview

This project is a visual learning tool designed to help users understand how code execution flows on embedded systems, particularly using Arduino boards. The system allows users to create programs by plugging in code blocks representing different actions (e.g., turning on LEDs, adding delays, etc.) and seeing the execution process in real time. The blocks can be rearranged and configured to visualize the flow of a program on the board.
